# REST routes, Express, EJS
## In this tutorial I'm following a UDEMY section on defining RESTful routes in Express
* get, post, patch, delete routes 
* defining espress routes 
* parsing the request body 
* getting ID from req.params 
* creating forms for different routes 
* UUID package (creating universally unique IDs)
* Express Method Override (for any methods other than GET and POST)
