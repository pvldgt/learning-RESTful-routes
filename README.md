## REST routes, Express, EJS
# In this tutorial I'm following a UDEMY section on defining RESTful routes in Express
* get, post, patch, delete routes 
* defining espress routes 
* parsing the request body 
* getting ID from req.params 
* creating forms for different routes 
Index - get = display all comments 
New - get = form to create a new comment 
Create - post = creates new comments 
Show - get = details for one specific comment 
Edit - get  = form to edit a comment 
Update - patch = updates a specified comment 
Destroy - delete = deletes a specified comment 
* UUID package (creating universally unique IDs)
* Express Method Override (for any methods other than GET and POST)
